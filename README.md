# FreshDa

This project, FreshDa, is intended for persons who are visually challenged to help them in identifying the fish which are safe from consumption, particularly those who have a compromised sense of smell. The machine model produced during the machine learning model training was tested through a series of simulated sensing events. Furthermore, the project is able to successfully classify the types of fish (MilkFish, Mackerel Scad, and Tilapia) and detect their freshness levels (Fresh and Stale).
